# PHP_OOP_Fundamentals
These are the exercise that I completed when reviewing OOP PHP Fundamentals for my Drupal 8 course.

If you choose to test these excercises out yourself follow the following steps

1. Clone the repo
2. Open your terminal
3. `cd` to the directory of where you cloned the repo
4. Type `php -S localhost:8000`
5. Open up a browser and navigate to localhost:8000/1/index.php to view the first lesson. Change the 1 to the different lessons. So for example if you want to view Lesson 7 you would go to localhost:8000/7/index.php
